# Fast API Tutorial

Learning python's FastAPI framework by taking the [FastAPI do Zero](https://fastapidozero.dunossauro.com/) course. See the app online [here](https://fast-api-tutorial.fly.dev/docs) ,deployed with FlyIO.

The course also involved building another, more complex (and cooler) API which can be found [here](https://github.com/Tomas-Tamantini/bookshelf).
